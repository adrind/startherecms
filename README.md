# [StartHereCMS](http://start-here-cms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) #

A flexible [Wagtail](https://wagtail.io/) app to make it easy to build simple guides for your city.
Developed after research from the [Anchorage Code for America](https://cfa-muni.tumblr.com) fellowship team.

Many cities offer services that are scattered across several agencies and nonprofits with no concrete
guide to let citizens know how they can access them. We developed StartHereCMS for [StartHereAnchorage](https://starthereanchorage.org)
to guide jobseekers to local Anchorage organizations that can help them with their job search.

StartHereCMS was designed to be as flexible and reusable as possible so other cities can make similar guides. It's so easy to 
make a copy of this website you can get it done in one afternoon, **no coding experience necessary**!

## Requirements ##
1. A [Heroku](https://heroku.com) account to host the website
2. An [AWS S3 bucket](https://aws.amazon.com) to hold images and documents

## Optional services you can use ##
1. An [Algolia](https://algolia.com) account to add search to your website (Free!)
2. [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com) to track what pages your user goes to (Free!)
3. [Google Maps API Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/) to let a user easily pick locations using the [Wagtail Geo Widget](https://github.com/Frojd/wagtail-geo-widget)
