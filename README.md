## How to use it ##

There are three basic templates you can create to make this "roadmap"

### Roadmap ###
The parent template -- a roadmap has a list of multiple "task lists" that need to be completed.
Example: a roadmap for a recent immigrant

### Task list ###
A task list has a singular focus that might require multiple steps to complete.
Example: a task list for "Identification" that outlines steps to getting IDs for I-9 eligibility

### Step page ###
Steps pages are the "leaves" of this Wagtail app tree -- each task list has multiple steps with information.
Example: a step page for how to obtain your Birth certificate
