We assume you've taken the steps to :doc:`sign up and launch your version<../quickstart>` of the CMS to Heroku, have a
:doc:`basic understanding of our CMS structure<../cms-structure>`, and currently have a website that looks like this:

And logging into the admin view at http://you-heroku-app-name.herokuapp.com/admin should look like this:

Use the username and password you created during the :doc:`Quickstart <quickstart>` section to login.

Going forward we'll use some icons to let you know about definitions and extra resources:

This icon means we have a link to a YouTube video to see a full walkthrough

    :alt: A magnifying glass

This icon means we are about to define a field in the Wagtail admin like the one below:

    :alt: A definition in the Wagtail admin

Now we're ready to make a website!
