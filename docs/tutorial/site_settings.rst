**Website Header Icon** - An icon that will appear next to the header text. Recommended that it matches your favicon
but not required. It will be rendered at 32px width so try to optimize for that size.

**Website Favicon** - The image that will appear in the tab for all your pages. We suggest we keep it similar to your
header icon (it can even be the same image as long as the dimensions are correct: 24px x 24px)

**Algolia App ID and Algolia Public Key** - If you want search on your website you need an
`Algolia.com <http://www.algolia.com>`_ account. Once you setup your account paste your App ID and Public Key
here and a search box should appear in the top right corner of the blue header text.

After adding all these site settings you should have a page that looks like this:
