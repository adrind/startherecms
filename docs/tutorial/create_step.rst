Steps are pages that help a user complete a Track. In our example about picking a dog breed,
the Steps will look like pages of information about each breed type.

**Title** - The name of the page -- this will appear as the text in the browser tab and as the header of the page.

**Short description** - The short description offers a preview of what the Step page is about. This will be shown on
the Track page to entice people to click on the link to this Step.

**Page Body** - The body of the page. Use this space to educate your user about the Step and send them to useful
websites and resources.

After you fill out the above basic fields, you should see something like this:

.. ATTENTION::
    Make sure you add the step pages in the Track page's folder in the admin interface. When you’re in the admin
    you need to make sure your Track page name is listed above the “Add Child Page” button.
    This means that you are adding Steps to that Track page.

After adding step pages for each dog breed my admin view looks like this, with the name of the Track at the top
(Breed Type) and the step pages listed below it.

Now, when you click “View Live” under the name of your track page, you should see a list of all the steps and their
short descriptions displayed. Cool!
