Adding sections to the homepage
===============================

Once you have some tracks and steps filled out you are ready to add your new pages to the :ref:`Home <home_page>` page!

Create sections on your Home page to help your user know what they need to tackle.
For example, most people need to know what kind of breed and where they want to adopt from before they actually get a
dog. Only after they have a dog can they then go shopping (since many things you need to buy for a dog depend on what
type of dog you have)
