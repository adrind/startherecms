=======================
First things first -- let’s create a very basic homepage. We need to make a new Home page in the Root directory.

**Title** - The title field is the title of your homepage (appears in the browser tab)

**Mission Statement** - The mission statement is a short description of the goal of your website. Let the user know what they should know how to do after following the steps in your website.

**Video** - An optional video to inform the user what they should expect from your website

We’ll get to **Sections** later after we create some Track and Step pages.

After creating the page in Wagtail we need to set it as the Root page -- this lets Wagtail know that this is the home page.
