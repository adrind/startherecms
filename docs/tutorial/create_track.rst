Pick Track type and fill out the basic information for the page.

**Title** - The name of the page -- this will appear as the text in the browser tab but not on the page itself.

**Page Body** - (optional) A space to provide some general information about the track -- explain why it’s important to
the overall goal of the website.

With these two fields filled out your page preview should look something like this:

Now we need to start adding some Step pages with content before we can create the **Options Form** section of the
Track page.
