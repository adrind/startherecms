About this project
******************

We designed this product when we noticed there was a need for easy to use guides that
communities can design on their own. Currently a lot of CMS solutions require a lot of
setup and management -- we wanted to streamline this to a simple design that could cover
a lot of civic use cases.

This CMS is used to provide a user with a clear set of steps they can take to accomplish a goal
and get connected to the right community resources to achieve that goal.

===================
How can I use this?
===================

Guides need to be as specific as possible to have the most success -- try to design for one user persona.
There should be a clear goal to your website that results in getting the user more connected to their local community.

We've identified some possible use cases:

* :doc:`Jobseeker guides <cms_templates/jobseeker>`
* Emergency response plans
* :doc:`Starting a small business <cms_templates/bizness>`
* Entering the community after prison
* Immigrating to your community

Some of these have :doc:`templates <quickstart/templates>` you can use to get a jump start on filling out the content.
