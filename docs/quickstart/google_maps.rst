Setting up Google Maps
======================

You can use Google Maps to embed maps on your Step pages that let your user easily download
directions and see the location of a Step on a map.

:ref:`Adding a location <location>` is easy to do once you have your Google Maps configured.


1. Go to `Google Maps Javascript API <https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/>`_ and sign in with your Google Credentials (preferably the same one you would want to use to set up Google Analytics if you intend to use analytics)

2. Click the "Get a Key" button, name your Project and accept their Terms and Conditions.
