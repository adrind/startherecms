Step Page
=========

A Step page is used to give a user a focused piece of information. There are a bunch of fields you can use to teach
someone about this Step in their journey.

This is what the editing template of a Step page looks like:

.. image:: ../_static/wagtail/step_admin_2.png
    :alt: The second section of the editing admin for a Step page

    :alt: The third section of the editing admin for a Step page

.. image:: ../_static/wagtail/step_admin_4.png
    :alt: The fourth section of the editing admin for a Step page

And here are where these fields map to on a Step page:

Some of these fields also appear on the Print page for the :ref:`Checklist <checklist>`:

And the short description on the Step page actually appears on the Track Page:
