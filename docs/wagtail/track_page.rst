A track lists the relavent :ref:`Steps <step>` a user can take to accomplish something.
Tracks also have an optional survey you can create to help a user narrow down their list of things to do and
focus on what they can feasibly get done.

Here's what the editing template of a Track looks like:

.. image:: ../_static/wagtail/track_admin_3.png
    :alt: The third section of the editing admin for a Track page
