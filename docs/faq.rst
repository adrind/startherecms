Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Some of the frequently asked questions we get:

**How can I create my own version of this website?**
    Follow our simple :doc:`Quickstart guide <quickstart>`

**How can I add a user to add content to the website pages?**
    Our :doc:`content contributors page <tutorial/content_contributors>` will show you how!

**How can I use my own domain?**
    There are several ways to buy custom domains and set them up with Heroku.
    `Heroku's guide <https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/custom-domains>`_ is the best source for this information.

**Why aren't my changes showing up?**
    Couple possibilities:

    1. You never “Published” the page you simply “Saved” them as a draft
    2. You are viewing the page in “Preview” mode

    Review :doc:`Basic Understanding of Wagtail <tutorial/basic_understanding>`


**Why aren't my Steps appearing on my Track page?**
    Did you just make a bunch of Step pages but they aren't appearing on your Track page? It's possible you made the
    pages without saving them in the right Track folder. Notice in this example how we are looking at a Track page
    (page type is outlined in red) and there is a list of Step pages underneath. This will automatically display
    links to all the Step pages saved under the Breed type Track.

    Now the steps will automatically appear on the track page:
