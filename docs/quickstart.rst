How to start a new website
==========================
There are a couple of services you need to sign up for before deploying your website to Heroku:

1. A `Heroku <https://www.heroku.com>`_ account
2. An `Amazon Web Services <https://aws.amazon.com>`_ account

Additionally there are some optional (free!) services you can use for added functionality:

* Google Analytics -- used to track how people use your website
* Google Maps -- used to let you set locations of community organizations on a map
* Algolia -- used to power a search box on your website so people can easily find pages

Once you sign up for these services you need the following keys to launch your application:
