Start Here CMS
==============

Start Here CMS was the result of the 2017 Code for America `Anchorage fellowship team <https://cfa-muni.tumblr.com>`_
when we designed an easy to use content management system to outline services in Anchorage that could help a jobseeker during their employment search.

It was created after our research lead us to understand that most government services rely on a web of
community organizations and support. We wanted to make this CMS as flexible as possible so other organizations can create their own CMS without writing any code.
